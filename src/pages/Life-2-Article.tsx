                  Sometimes, when we reflect on our past, we feel a deep sense
                  of regret or sadness. We wonder,{" "}
                  <em>‚ÄúWhy did I make those mistakes?‚Äù</em>,{" "}
                  <em>‚ÄúWhy couldn‚Äôt I understand things earlier?‚Äù</em> And these
                  thoughts often hold us back from moving forward.
                </p>
                <p>
                  But life isn‚Äôt just about the mistakes we‚Äôve made ‚Äî it‚Äôs about
                  not repeating them.
                </p>
                <p>Today, I want to share</p>
                <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold pt-6">My Story</h2>
                <p>
                  There came a point in my life when things started to change ‚Äî
                  I experienced new beginnings, a few moments of joy ‚Äî and I
                  kept moving forward.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I completed my 12th in commerce, and then took a leap into the
                  world of computers by enrolling in <strong>BCA</strong>.I
                  stepped into this new domain with hope and ambition.
                </p>
                <p>
                  During my BCA journey, I initially thought I was doing
                  something different ‚Äî something unique. But soon, I realized I
                  was wrong. Everyone around me was entering the world of
                  computers too. But by then, I had already taken my first steps
                  into the tech world.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Like many students, I used to procrastinate{" "}
                  <em>"I'll study tomorrow, today I‚Äôm not in the mood..."</em>{" "}
                  and days passed by. Slowly, learning stopped. And when I saw
                  others progressing or landing jobs, I felt a sting ‚Äî{" "}
                  <em>"If only I had done what they did‚Ä¶"</em> But that‚Äôs where
                  we make a big mistake ‚Äî{" "}
                  <strong>
                    we get so busy watching others that we forget to work on
                    ourselves.
                  </strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                  After completing my BCA, job opportunities were limited. The
                  knowledge I had wasn‚Äôt enough for what companies expected. So
                  I decided to pursue{" "}
                  <strong>MCA (Master of Computer Applications)</strong> with
                  one goal ‚Äî placement. I searched for colleges, visited many
                  campuses, and finally took admission in a medium-tier college.
                </p>
                <p>
                  But soon, I learned that getting placed wasn‚Äôt going to be
                  that easy.
                </p>
                <p>
                  After 1.5 years of MCA and giving countless interviews, one
                  thing a professor said really stuck with me:
                </p>

                <blockquote className="italic border-l-4 pl-4 border-primary text-muted-foreground">
                  "You can have certificates from the biggest companies, but if
                  you can‚Äôt answer a basic question ‚Äî that certificate is
                  worthless."
                </blockquote>

                <p>
                  That hit hard. Today, students hesitate to ask questions out
                  of fear. But if we don‚Äôt ask, we don‚Äôt learn. Eventually, I
                  cracked a job in an MNC in Gandhinagar ‚Äî a proud moment.
                  But...
                </p>

                <blockquote className="italic border-l-4 pl-4 border-primary text-muted-foreground">
                  The real story was just about to begin.
                </blockquote>

                <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold pt-6">Takeaway</h2>
                <p>
                  Don't be trapped by your past. Everyone makes mistakes. What
                  matters is whether you <strong>learn</strong> from them and{" "}
                  <strong>move forward</strong>.
                </p>

                <p>
                  ‚ú® Who you are today is a result of your past decisions.{" "}
                  <br />
                  But <strong>who you become tomorrow</strong> depends on what
                  you do <strong>today</strong>.
